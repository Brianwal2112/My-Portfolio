                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Founded in 2026, TableEase began with a simple vision: to create a dining experience that celebrates both exceptional cuisine and effortless service. Our founders, passionate about food and hospitality, set out to create a restaurant where guests could enjoy innovative dishes in a warm, welcoming atmosphere.</p>
                    
                    <p>What started as a small neighborhood bistro has grown into a beloved destination for food enthusiasts seeking creative interpretations of classic dishes. Our commitment to quality ingredients, innovative techniques, and outstanding service remains unwavering.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>We believe that dining is more than just eating—it's an experience that engages all the senses. Our kitchen team sources the finest seasonal ingredients from local farms and producers, crafting dishes that highlight natural flavors while adding unexpected touches of creativity.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our service philosophy centers on anticipation—providing what our guests need before they realize they need it, without intruding on their experience. This approach has earned us recognition as one of the top dining destinations in the city.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Our Team</h2>
